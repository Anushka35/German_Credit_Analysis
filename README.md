Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data, understanding distributions, and identifying patterns.
Machine Learning Models: Building predictive models using various algorithms for credit risk assessment.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Interpretability: Understanding the key factors influencing credit risk decisions.
Deployment: Options for deploying the model in real-world scenarios.

# Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebooks
Dataset Source: Kaggle - German Credit Risk
